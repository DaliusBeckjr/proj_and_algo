# proj_and_algo


these are algorithms from the bootcamp and other algorithms that are sourced out from codewars or even leetcode. My favorite one to use so far is codewars. 

at the moment I am doing a coding challenge and planning to try to solve one coding challenge a day to boost my problem solving (start: oct 4, 2023)

alot of these problems will be more of me thinking through the day but trying to keep a timer to solve them in 60 min with an extra 30 min if struggling.

the reason for the challenge is to take me out of my comfort zone and force me to understand that the world will always have a problem everyday whether I am prepared or not but it was the notion of this being a NEED for me to have a learning expereince and not be lazy.

feel free to stay up to date on my twitter where I am posting each one I solve and also come back to the [365_challenge](./365_challenge/) folder

and always. happy coding. learn more, be postitive on this long journey. "coding a day keeps the doctors away" is what I say.
